"""Gate 4 — Community Notes-style bipartisan agreement check.

A submission requires SAME-DIRECTION votes from at least 2 distinct factions
to pass merge consideration. This prevents:
- AI-trusters always voting against challenges (single-faction rejection)
- AI-skeptics always voting for challenges (single-faction acceptance)

Per meta/community.md.
