# Meta — agent operating system

Five files that govern how the agent self-improves:

```
meta/
├── north_star.md   IMMUTABLE — the goal. Human-PR only.
├── actor.md        MUTABLE — current pipeline policy. Actor edits, must align with north_star.
├── critique.md     MUTABLE — how to evaluate the actor. Edited only by learn.md proposals.
├── community.md    MUTABLE — crowdsourcing layer governing human-in-the-loop contributions.
└── learn.md        IMMUTABLE — meta-meta loop that improves critique + community. Human-PR only.
```

## Loop

## Roles

- **north_star.md** — defines the optimization objective + quality bar. Never changes without human approval.
- **actor.md** — defines current pipeline policy + calibration. Self-edits in response to critique. All edits via git for auditability.
- **critique.md** — defines how to grade actor's outputs. Updated by learn's proposals (human-approved).
- **community.md** — governs crowdsourced contributions (challenges, alternatives, annotations). Twitter-Community-Notes-style bipartisan agreement; reputation system; AI-driven scraper for external mentions.
- **learn.md** — meta-meta: analyzes git history of actor + critique + outcome metrics + community signals, proposes improvements. Never self-modifies.

## Why 5 layers

| Layer | Mutability | Edited by | Defends against |
|---|---|---|---|
| north_star | immutable | human only | Goodhart on the objective itself |
| actor | mutable | actor | Pipeline becomes static / can't improve |
| critique | mutable | learn (proposed), human (approved) | Critique becomes biased / blind |
| community | mutable | learn (proposed), human (approved) | AI critique drifts from real practitioners |
| learn | immutable | human only | Self-improvement loop optimizes away from the goal |

Each layer's mutability is one less than the layer below it. This prevents any layer from rewriting its own constitution.

Critique and community are PARALLEL evidence sources (neither dominates) — both feed `learn` which arbitrates.

## Operational cadence

| Cadence | Action |
|---|---|
| Per pipeline run | actor executes; critique evaluates and writes report |
| Daily | actor commits any policy updates from accumulated critiques |
| Weekly | learn analyzes attribution, opens PR with critique improvements |
| Quarterly | human audit: sample critique-driven actor commits, validate improvements were genuine |

## Invariants

These must hold at all times:
1. north_star.md hash is in the build manifest
2. Every actor.md commit references at least one critique report ID in its message
3. Every critique.md change came through a learn-proposed PR
4. learn.md never appears in `git log --author=actor` or `git log --author=critique`
5. Held-out fixture set passes at all times (≥ 95% verdict accuracy)

## How to inspect the system's health

```bash
# Latest platform metrics
cat data/meta_runs/metrics.jsonl | tail -1

# Recent actor evolution
git log -p meta/actor.md | head -100

# Recent critique evolution
git log -p meta/critique.md | head -100

# Asymmetric loss trend (last 10 runs)
jq '.asymmetric_loss' data/meta_runs/metrics.jsonl | tail -10

# Fixture pass rate
uv run python examples/run_meta_loop.py
```
