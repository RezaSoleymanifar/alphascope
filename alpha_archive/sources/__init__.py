"""Paper source pollers — curated-first hierarchy.

PRIMARY (high-signal, low-noise — ship by default):
  - alpha_architect: hand-curated by Wes Gray's team, often pre-replicated
  - aqr:             AQR research insights (Asness, Frazzini, Pedersen)
  - two_sigma:       Two Sigma research blog
  - nber:            NBER finance working papers (peer-academic)

BACKGROUND (volume, heavily LLM-triaged):
  - arxiv:           q-fin categories, ~30-50 papers/day, mostly noise

DEPRIORITIZED (in repo for future, not active):
  - ssrn:            scraping unreliable; better via official partnerships
  - twitter/reddit/substack: dropped — let critics file GitHub issues instead

Each module exposes:
    poll() -> list[dict]   # standardized paper records
